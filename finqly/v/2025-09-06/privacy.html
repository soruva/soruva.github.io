    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: September 6, 2025</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how SoruvaLab (“we,” “us,” or “our”) handles information in connection with the Finqly app (“App”). Finqly is designed to work without accounts or sign-in.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII). The App is fully functional without login or registration.</p>

    <h2>2. Local-Only Storage</h2>
    <p>All data—such as diagnosis results and emotional history—is stored only on your device (e.g., local storage/SharedPreferences). We do not transmit or back up this data to our servers.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed by Google Play. We do not receive your payment card details. The App may receive a purchase token from Google Play to unlock premium features; this token is handled on-device only and is not linked by us to your identity or sent to our servers. For details on Google’s processing, please refer to Google’s privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>4. No Third-Party Analytics or Ads</h2>
    <p>Finqly does not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, cookies, or tracking tools.</p>

    <h2>5. External Links</h2>
    <p>When you open external links (e.g., help forms or legal pages), they are opened in your browser and governed by the destination site’s privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because all Finqly data is stored locally, uninstalling the App removes the stored data. You can also clear the App’s storage from your device settings. If you wish to contact us about deletion or other privacy requests, you can use our
      <a href="https://forms.gle/Vr6G6p1ngcVC1Niz6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Form</a> or email us.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>We aim to respect privacy expectations in applicable jurisdictions (e.g., GDPR/CCPA). Since the App does not collect or transmit personal data, rights such as access or erasure generally do not apply; however, you may still contact us with any questions or requests.</p>

    <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Please check this page periodically for changes.</p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Finqly name, logo, and related assets are the intellectual property of SoruvaLab. Unauthorized use is prohibited. While trademarks may not be officially registered at this time, we assert prior-use rights under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>You may not use the App’s insights or interface for commercial purposes, data mining, or reverse engineering. Finqly is provided for personal, non-commercial use only.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Policy, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@soruvalab.com">support@soruvalab.com</a>.
